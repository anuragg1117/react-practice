🚀 React Practice (Using CDN and Vanilla JS)
✅ Initialized a React project without any build tools (no CRA/Vite), using CDN links in a plain HTML file.

    🧠 Practiced using React.createElement() to manually create virtual DOM elements.

    👨‍👩‍👧 Created a nested element structure — a parent <div> containing a child <div>, which includes a heading (<h1>).

    🔁 Explored rendering multiple React elements including sibling and child components.

    🧪 Used ReactDOM.createRoot() and root.render() to render the React elements to the actual DOM.

    📂 Organized project into separate files:

        index.html for structure

        app.js for logic

        practice.css for styling (optional at this stage)
